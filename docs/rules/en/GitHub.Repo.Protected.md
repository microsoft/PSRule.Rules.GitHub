# Use branch protection on the default branch

## SYNOPSIS

Enable branch protection on the repository default branch.

## DESCRIPTION

Branch protection rules ensure that collaborators on your repository cannot make irrevocable changes to branches.
When a branch protection is enabled for a branch, commits are added through a pull request workflow.
Additional options can also be configured to enforce additional requirements, such as passing status checks and required reviews.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider enabling branch protection on the repository default branch.
