# Use a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file

## SYNOPSIS

Use a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file in the default branch to set standards for community engagement.

## DESCRIPTION

The CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file is used to communicate expectations for behavior of project participants.
When someone opens a pull request or creates an issue, they will see a link to the code of conduct.
For public projects, code of conduct is included in GitHub's community profile scorecard.

A CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file can be created in the repository root, `.github/`, or `docs/` directories.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider creating a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file in the default branch to set standards for community engagement.
