# Use a CONTRIBUTING file

## SYNOPSIS

Use a CONTRIBUTING.md file in the default branch to communicate how to contribute to the project.

## DESCRIPTION

The CONTRIBUTING.md file is used to communicate guidelines on how people should contribute.
When someone opens a pull request or creates an issue, they will see a link to the contributing guidelines.
For public projects, contributing guidelines is included in GitHub's community profile scorecard.

A CONTRIBUTING.md file can be created in the repository root, `.github/`, or `docs/` directories.

## RECOMMENDATION
